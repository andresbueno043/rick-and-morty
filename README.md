> Welcome to the Rick and Morty Characters application! This app was created with a burning passion to showcase my frontend development skills and impress recruiters.

## Key Features

-   Displays a list of characters from the popular TV series Rick and Morty.
-   Users can expand character cards to view more information.
-   Users can select a character as their favorite.

## Technologies Used

-   React JS: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   Vite: Fast and optimized development tool for React JS projects.
-   Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling and design.

## Harnessing the Power of Custom Hooks, useContext, and Asynchronous Fetch

This project extensively utilizes the following React concepts and functionalities:

-   Custom Hooks: Custom hooks have been created to encapsulate reusable logic, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
-   useContext: React context is used to manage and share global state across the application, enabling easy access to data in different components.
-   Asynchronous Fetch to a Public API: Asynchronous calls are made to a public API to fetch data for Rick and Morty characters using the `fetch` function.

## Project Architecture

The project follows a simple architecture based on functional components. Components are integrated within the main component, which is rendered on the screen.

## Challenges and Learning Experience

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered various challenges that fueled my passion and drove me to expand my skills. Here are some highlights:

-   Utilizing the useRef Hook: I mastered the useRef hook, harnessing its power to efficiently access DOM elements and perform operations on them.
-   Implementing the Search Functionality: I developed a search bar that filters characters based on user input, refining my data manipulation and array searching skills.
-   Research and Documentation: I delved into React's official documentation and other reliable sources to overcome technical hurdles. In addition, I sought guidance from auxiliary tools like ChatGPT whenever I needed further direction.
